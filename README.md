# helper-cli

#### general info

A WIP helper CLI (hopefully) to help me understand Rust. Currently a work in progress - will *hopefully* be released at some point in the future. 

#### using the helper cli

Currently the assignments and tests parts works as expected. Other features will be added. If you would like to try it out, ensure you have cargo installed, clone the repository, and use `cargo run` or `cargo build` to try it out. Run the app in the directory where you want it to create the `helper-files` directory.
