# helper-cli

#### general info

A WIP helper CLI (hopefully) to help me understand Rust. Currently a work in progress - will *hopefully* be released at some point in the future. 

Currently the assignments part works as expected. Other features will be added. If you would like to try it out, ensure you have cargo installed, clone the repository, and use `cargo run` or `cargo build` to try it out.

#### using the helper cli

Once you have started the cli, it will ask you for a path to create its directory. For this, type it in the format `C:/Users/USER1` and it will make the directory. After that, all the instructions are in the app.
